*A machine learning model predicting the survival of Titanic passengers*

*Language:* R

The repository contains an R script for predicting the survival status of the Titanic passengers listed in the *test.csv* file of the famous [Kaggle Titanic competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). The machine learning model used to make these predictions is trained on the *train.csv* file data. Both *test.csv* and *train.csv* are available on the [competition web site](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).
